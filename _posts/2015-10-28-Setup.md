# Hi

I am Pankaj Kataria a third year UnderGrad in BTech Computer Science major at IIT Roorkee.I write code,love linux,cook scripts,smash the stacks,kill my enemies and exercise on daily basis.I love to take part in Capture the Flag Competitions and I am part of a awesome team ColonelPanic which is a community of security enthusiast united under the notion of World Domination through Capture the Flag Competitions here at IIT Roorkee.
	
# My Workplace

Well these days the most powerfull Weapon that Developer possess is his/her laptop. I use a 15"Dell Inspiron Turbo that i got in 2013.It has an Intel powered I7-3632QM processor with Nvidia GeForce GT 540M graphics card and 8GB of memory hooked up to a 1TB WD Portable Hard Drive and i carry a 32GB iPhone 5s to answer my calls.
	
# My Softwares

For the Sotwares ,currently i use Ubuntu(14.04) + Numix on my laptop.Well being shifted to linux for almost 2 years my distribution is not normal anymore as a result of my Countless experiments ranging from manually modifying my daily tools code like wine,vim etc to adding modified gestures inputs to the Os.

For Capture the flag Competitions me and my teammates maintains an awesome repository known as [TeamColonelPanic tools](https://github.com/TeamColonelPanic/tools) where some of the most often tool and references are kept regarding CTF Competitions.

Most of my non-coding time is spent on the web. I am a stackexhange addict.Gmail,Twitter,Tumblr & Github are my most used web apps.  

# Future and Beyond

Well I am pretty much Happy with the logic that binds the reality around me.
But if given a opportunity i would like a laptop with the charm of a Mac ,power of system76 with battery capacity for days.
And if we are talking normal i would love to have J.A.R.V.I.S and be Batman.
